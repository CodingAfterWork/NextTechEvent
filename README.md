# NextTechEvent
This is a project we are building our Twitch channel https://twitch.tv/CodingAfterWork.  
This page will help you as a conference speaker, attendee or organizer to find your next conference.

## Speaker
This site contains an aggregation of many different sources for call for paper like Sessionize, Papercall.io, Confs.Tech, Joind.in It will help you as a speaker to not submit to different conferences that take place the same time (ask us how we know this is a problem). It not only aggregates information but also adds more information on top like weather forecasts.

## Attendee
As an attendee it will help you to find your next tech event based on location, date, and technology

## Organizer
As an organizer, we will help you with finding a good date to organize your event. Perhaps you are looking for a time slot when no other conferences are happening, or you might look for a time when close to when another conference is happening close by and work with that conference.
